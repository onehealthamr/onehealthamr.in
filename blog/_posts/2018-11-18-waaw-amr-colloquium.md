The colloquium on strengthening antibiotic stewardship was organized on November 16th at Insititute of Public Health.

Lt Gen D Raghunath inaugurated the colloquium and spoke. "We must realize we are dealing with organisms that have seen antibiotics from the beginning", he said before concluding.

"Let us look at alternative approaches", said Dr Maneesh Paul who is a member of the IDSA's AMR committee.

There were discussions on navigational issues in our pluralistic health system, various directions of research in clinical pharmacology, and about the bane of specialization and need for genuine pluralism. Data on AMR from rural and urban settings were presented and analyzed. The role of newer technologies like next generation sequencing and information technology was discussed.

The group resolved to work together towards strengthening antibiotic stewardship concocting strategies to do so.
